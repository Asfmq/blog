Abstract:
    We present 22901 OB spectra of 16032 stars identified from the Large
    Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope data release 5
    (LAMOST DR5) data set. A larger sample of OB candidates are first
    selected from the distributions in the spectral line indices' space.
    Then, all 22901 OB spectra are identified by manual inspection. Based
    on a subsample validation, we find that the completeness of the OB
    spectra reaches about 89+/-22% for the stars with spectral types
    earlier than B7, while around 57+/-16% B8-B9 stars are identified. The
    smaller completeness for late B stars will lead to the difficulty in
    discriminating them from A0-A1-type stars. The subclasses of the OB
    samples are determined using the software package MKCLASS. With a
    careful validation using 646 subsamples, we find that MKCLASS can give
    fairly reliable subtypes and luminosity classes for most of the OB
    stars. The uncertainty of the spectral subtype is around 1 subtype,
    and the uncertainty of the luminosity class is around 1 level.
    However, about 40% of the OB stars fail to be assigned to any class by
    MKCLASS, and a few spectra are significantly misclassified by MKCLASS.
    This is likely because the template spectra of MKCLASS are selected
    from nearby stars in the solar neighborhood, while the OB stars in
    this work are mostly located in the outer disk and may have lower
    metallicities. The rotation of the OB stars may also be responsible
    for the misclassifications. Moreover, we find that the spectral and
    luminosity classes of the OB stars located in the Galactic latitude
    larger than 20{deg} are substantially different with those located in
    the latitude smaller than 20{deg}, which may either be due to the
    observational selection effect or may hint a different origin of the
    high Galactic latitude OB stars.

Note (1): We apply MKCLASS, which is an automatic classification package 
    developed by Gray & Corbally (2014AJ....147...80G), to classify the
    spectral subtype and luminosity class for the identified OB stars.
    MKCLASS assigns question marks to 4922 spectra and 89 "Unclassifiable".
    Moreover, MKCLASS cannot converge to a single type but provides
    discrepant classifications with different criteria for 4422 spectra.
    In these cases, MKCLASS outputs flags like "kB8hA9mK0 Eu", which means
    that the K-line determined spectral type is B8, the hydrogen-line
    determined type is A9, and the metallic-line classified type is K0.
    See Section 4 for further explanations.
