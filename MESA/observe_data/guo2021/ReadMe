Abstract:
    Massive stars play key roles in many astrophysical processes. Deriving
    the atmospheric parameters of massive stars is important to
    understanding their physical properties, and thus the atmospheric
    parameters are key inputs to trace the evolution of massive stars.
    Here we report our work on adopting the data-driven technique called
    stellar label machine (SLAM) with the nonlocal thermal equilibrium
    TLUSTY synthetic spectra as the training data set to estimate the
    stellar parameters of Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic
    Telescope (LAMOST) optical spectra for early-type stars. We apply two
    consistency tests to verify this machine-learning method and compare
    stellar labels given by SLAM with the labels in the literature for
    several objects having high-resolution spectra. We provide the stellar
    labels of effective temperature (Teff), surface gravity (logg),
    metallicity ([M/H]), and projected rotational velocity (vsini) for
    3931 and 578 early-type stars from the LAMOST low-resolution survey
    (LRS) and medium-resolution survey (MRS), respectively. To estimate
    the average statistical uncertainties of our results, we calculated
    the standard deviation between the predicted stellar label and the
    prelabeled published values from the high-resolution spectra. The
    uncertainties of the four parameters are {sigma}(Teff)=2185K,
    {sigma}(logg)=0.29dex, and {sigma}(vsini)=11km/s for MRS, and
    {sigma}(Teff)=1642K, {sigma}(logg)=0.25dex, and {sigma}(vsini)=42km/s
    for LRS spectra, respectively. We note that the parameters of Teff,
    logg, and [M/H] can be better constrained using LRS spectra than using
    MRS spectra, most likely due to their broad wavelength coverage, while
    vsini is constrained better by MRS spectra than by LRS spectra,
    probably due to the relatively accurate line profiles of MRS spectra.

Description:
    LAMOST is a 4m quasi-meridian reflecting Schmidt telescope located at
    the Xinlong station of the National Astronomical Observatory. Both a
    low-resolution spectrograph (LRS; R~1800 with wavelength coverage
    of 3690~9100{AA}) and a medium-resolution spectrograph (MRS; R~7500
    blue arm: 4950~5350{aa} and red arm 6300~6800{AA}) were installed on
    the telescope.
    LAMOST finished the first observing campaign from 2011 to 2018 (known
    as LAMOST I). The second active survey program (LAMOST II) began in
    2017 September.

    Liu+ (2019, J/ApJS/241/32) identified 16032 early-type stars through
    measuring the equivalent widths of several absorption line profiles
    using low-resolution spectra from the LAMOST low-resolution survey
    (LRS) database. Guo+ (2022RAA....22b5009G) used the spectra from the
    LAMOST MRS database to investigate the multiplicity properties of
    early-type stars (Paper I).

    In this study, we adopt all of the identified O- and B-type stars from
    Liu+ (2019, J/ApJS/241/32) and Paper I to derive the stellar labels of
    their spectra by applying the Stellar LAbel Machine (SLAM;
    Zhang+ 2020ApJS..246....9Z and 2020RAA....20...51Z).
